# The Breakdown

This is an effort on our part to improve on the vanilla Cyberpunk 2077 experience as much as possible. Whilst at the same time doing so seamlessly. We want this to feel like what Cyberpunk 2077 always should have been at launch, and we only incorporate things we feel should have been there since the beginning. Staying as true to the lore as possible, but also taking some liberties when needed for the sake of gameplay.

Simply put, this is a kitchen sink of a modlist that covers just about every area we could think of. Whether it be bug fixes, models and textures, cosmetics, game balance, gameplay mechanics, or interactivity with the game world. We had Yakuza in mind when we made it.

Remember to read everything carefully. As of revision 433 of the collection, we can confidently say that this collection is compatible with version 1.63 of the game. You shouldn't have any problems.

# It's A Jack of All Trades

This basically makes changes to almost everything that we felt needed to be changed or improved upon.

Cars handle better overall, and cars can actually be modified with **[Cyber Vehicle Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3016)** and **[Car Modification Shop](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4034)**. There are also more controls inside of the car to switch lights on or off, and open or close windows with **[Extra Vehicle Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3225)**. **[Virtual Car Dealer](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4454)** allows you to buy a whole assortment of existing vehicles that you couldn't buy before. Inhalers and injectors are not as overpowered as they are in vanilla thanks to **[Toxicity](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4317)**, but we also add variety to them with **[WE3D - Drugs of Night City](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4407)**. Which gives you more options, but also forces you to think about which ones you are going to use in a fight. As you can now overdose if you take too many of them. Improvements have been made to them as well. Not just the drugs.

Stamina has been reworked because it was kind of an afterthought originally with **[Sensible Stamina and Athletics](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2861)**. You never had to really watch your stamina before, and it was way too plentiful. Now you actually have to resource manage, and watch how much stamina you use in a fight. Jumping, double jumping, wall jumping, and parkour has been revamped extensively through **[Alternative Midair Movement and Walljumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5160)**.

Improvements have been made to Netrunners. They both feel more organic and versatile than they did in vanilla, and have a lot more in their arsenal than they did before due to **[Amateur Hackers](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4880)** and **[AI Netrunners Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2468)**. Which means Self-Ice is going to be a lot more useful. Cyberdecks have been rebalanced across the board as well with the introduction of **[Cyberdeck Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5055)** to the collection. 

Likewise, we included improvements to ragdoll physics and gore with **[Ragdoll Physics Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3858)** and **[More Blood Splatters](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3975)**.

Some improvements have been made to Judy, Panam, Kerry, and River through **[Judy Romanced Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4508)**, **[Panam Romanced Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4626)**, **[Kerry Interactions Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4990)**, and **[River Romanced Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4870)**. In regards to their their romantic liaisons. In other words there is more to do with them after you become romantically involved. 

We included a lot of bug fixes. You can check them out in the modlist, but we doubt you will need anything else. As of the latest revisions the most obvious problems in the game have been addressed.

We also changed sticky grenades so that they now behave more like mines through **[Sticky Mines](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4921)**. Which means that they still stick to people and surfaces as per usual but they only detonate when an enemy is in proximity of them. Which will allow you to set up traps with them. All leg cyberware has been tweaked with **[Leg Cyberware Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4336)**, and essentials like **[Always First Equip](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2557)** are here. There is **[System-EX](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3158)**, which allows you to equip both a cyberdeck and an operating system at the same time, allowing for more flexibility in various builds. We also included **[Equipment-EX](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6945)** to improve the new Wardrobe System.

As of recent we also incorporated **[Time Dilation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4931)** which drastically changes and improves all forms of time-dilation in the game, including when you use the scanner for any wireless hacking or any Sandevistan implant. It rebalances all of it, and even adds new cyberware. Now there is variation for all of them that is actually meaningful, and penalties to prevent them from being overpowered. Each favoring different kinds of weapons like blades or guns, and providing you with new abilities for them during any time-dilation. Such as deflecting bullets back at enemies with melee weapons, or even short range teleportation.

A whole coterie of quality of life mods. There are **[Clear Skill Checks](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2805)** and **[Convo Skill Check Scaling](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2886)**, which means you're going to know exactly how much of an attribute you need to pass skill checks, and an increase in difficulty for them all. Since normally they're way too easy to succeed at regardless of your character build. The Projectile Launcher System has been revamped with each missile having a different effect, and in general it has been rebalanced via **[Projectile Launcher Rework](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6925)**. It does a lot more damage, and is actually a viable weapon. Instead of doing the terrible damage it does normally. This can also be customized to your liking via Projectile Launcher Rework in the mod settings.

A bunch of mods to add interactivity or immersion to the game world. You can choose to disassemble loot you find instead of picking it up, and automatically disassemble loot of a certain rarity with **[Disassemble As Looting Choice](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4648)**. You can now unequip cyberware with **[Unequip Cyberware](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2282)**. Then finally we included a **[Simple Flashlight](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2913)** to illuminate darker areas. It can be switched off and on at your leisure.

On top of that we included a vastly improved crafting and upgrade system. There is **[Enhanced Craft](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4378)** which allows you to switch between skins for weapons, and choose their damage type. Whether it be Physical, Chemical, Thermal, or Electrical as well as **[Crafting Quality of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4453)** to allow recrafting iconics and crafting mods at lower quality levels.

# Installation and Configuration

For **[Enhanced Craft](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4378)**, if you're using a controller go to the Mod Settings for it and activate the controller support. Otherwise, you won't be able to switch between skins when crafting for any weapons or any clothing. 

Any of the settings in Mod Settings and Native Settings UI can be tweaked to your liking from our preset defaults. 

```
If you've ever modded Cyberpunk before, it's important to ensure you have a clean game folder
```

Go to your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory and delete the **all** folders except for **"archive"**

![delete folders step for clean install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/wjack%20readme%203.png)

Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"** 

![deleting the mod folder step for clean install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z9er/CyberpunkTHING/main/resources/images/wabbajack%20readme/wjack%20readme%204.png)

Now make sure you go and verify your game files through **Steam** or **GOG**

```
You will need to do the following steps to ensure a good foundation if you are an existing user.
