  One common cause for this is the **Wabbajack** client not being on the same hard drive as the game install, another is forgetting to have **Steam** or **GOG** verify and reacquire files as part of doing a cleaning of your Cyberpunk 2077 install

  In order to use the included mod [Simple Flashlight](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2913) open the "Game Folder Files" folder in your modlist install location, and copy the archive folder into your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory

  &#10240;
  
  To keep some of your custom mods when updating the **Wabbajack** rename the mods in **MO2** and add [NoDelete] on the left hand MO2 pane. As example "Dawn FM" becomes "[NoDelete] Dawn FM"

  <summary>Quality of Life and Bug Fixes</summary>
  &#10240;
  
  Launching the game through MO2 means that those rewards do not populate in your game as they have to go through CDPR's launcher. The easiest workaround is to in your new game run it without the modlist active (running through **GOG** or **Steam**), go through the prologue to your apartment and get the items, then launch the game through **MO2** to use the list after that

Then leave the apartment and reenter to complete the reset

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a 
mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a 
new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog

<details><summary>CET Setup</summary>
## CET Setup

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

When you start the game for the first time you will be met with an overlay prompting you to choose a key to toggle on Cyber Engine Tweaks, recommend that you choose the **"~"** key for the **"Overlay Key"**

![First CET Popup](https://i.imgur.com/lgIR1mi.png)

The main **"Cyber Engine Tweaks"** window will now pop up, and on it you should click the **"Bindings"** button near the top left of the window

![CET Binding](https://i.imgur.com/HiLTXZA.png)

Recommend binding keys for **"BetterScopes",** **"CustomQuickslots",** **"NanoDrone",** and **"QuestTrackingToggle"** in the **"Bindings"** section that pops up

Below the section there is a **"Save"** button which you should click to save any changes

<details><summary>Quickslots Settings</summary>
## Quickslots Settings

![spacer](https://i.imgur.com/42dA30s.png)

In Cyberpunk, there is no way to bind multiple hotkeys for actions, items, or abilities, as each must be assigned through the menu to the one assignable hotkey at a time, leading to gameplay interruptions if you want to play well. [Custom Quickslots](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3096) solves this issue by allowing bindable hotkeys which show up on the Native game UI and allow you up to 20 hotkeyed actions, abilities, or items. Some small setup is required

```
Navigating the Mods menu uses the arrows at the top to switch between the different pages of mods
```

After clicking **"Mods"** in the main menu, navigate to the **"QSLOTS"** section, recommend changing **"Other Consumable Item Mods Compatibility Mode,"** **"Hide empty consumable and grenade slots,"** **"Hide empty cyberware ability slots"** and **"Small item slots"** to **"On"**. Recommend changing **"Number of Custom Quickslots"** to **"0"** and then adding slots as needed during the course of gameplay.

![Gameplay Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/mAUjyAW.png)

Near the right side of the top menu click on the **"INTERFACE"** section, recommend changing **"Damage Numbers Mode"** to **"Off,"** **"Overhead Damage Numbers"** to **"None,"** and **"Threat and Damage Indicator"** to **"Damage Only"**

![Interface Recommended Settings Combined](https://i.imgur.com/6JNViAW.png)
