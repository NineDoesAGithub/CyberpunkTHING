Additionally delete the **"mod"** folder in **"Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/"**

![Clean Install 2](https://i.imgur.com/YW0s73X.png)

```
Do not update any of the mods in the collection individually in Vortex! The philosophy of this collection is that when a 
mod updates, we update a full revision in order to keep everything up to date and interfacing correctly; when you see a 
new revision, update to it. If anything special is needed we will mention it in the changelog

# Premium vs Non-Premium

For premium Nexus users installing this collection is a one click process as below

![A GIF showing how with nexus premium the collection can be installed with one click](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOTU4NmJiM2Q4Y2QxYzI5MjQyMDViN2RmYTU5MWIyMjU3MzkzZjg0MSZjdD1n/HEGph9HbpardEJUFgk/giphy.gif)
