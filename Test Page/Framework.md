#### For the first time on Nexus, two fully featured collections in one: the future of modding is here. You shouldn't need a degree from Arasaka Academy just to be able to enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 with mods. We provide a fully preconfigured and easy to use modded experience comprising the best community mods and our own; it just works, plug n' play.

  One common cause for this is the **Wabbajack** client not being on the same hard drive as the game install, another is forgetting to have **Steam** or **GOG** verify and reacquire files as part of doing a cleaning of your Cyberpunk 2077 install

  In order to use the included mod [Simple Flashlight](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2913) open the "Game Folder Files" folder in your modlist install location, and copy the archive folder into your main Cyberpunk 2077 directory

  To keep some of your custom mods when updating the **Wabbajack** rename the mods in **MO2** and add [NoDelete] on the left hand MO2 pane. As example "Dawn FM" becomes "[NoDelete] Dawn FM"

  Launching the game through MO2 means that those rewards do not populate in your game as they have to go through CDPR's launcher. The easiest workaround is to in your new game run it without the modlist active (running through **GOG** or **Steam**), go through the prologue to your apartment and get the items, then launch the game through **MO2** to use the list after that
